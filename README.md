# unit-testing

I believe in automated testing: unit testing, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and algorithm performance tests. Python gives us the unittest and pytest libraries which be helpful for automated testing. Here I'll create some pretty trivial examples but in practice I try to always create a minimum of 1 unit test for function.
